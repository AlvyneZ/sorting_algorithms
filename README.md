# sorting-algorithms
## Author: AlvyneZ
This repository contains C program source code for implementing different sorting algorithms in C  

### Big-O files
The 0-O, 1-O, ... files give the time complexities of the implemented sorting algorithms
 in big-O notation with the following format:
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- n + k -> O(n+k)
- ...

And with the following order:
1. in the best case
2. in the average case
3. in the worst case
